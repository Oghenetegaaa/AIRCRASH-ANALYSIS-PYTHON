# AIRCRASH-ANALYSIS-PYTHON
## INTRODUCTION
Air travel is one of the means of transportation that various people around the world use to commute to different locations. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights from historical air crashes using Python Promgrammming Language.

## Research Questions
1. What is the total number of aircrashes, fatalities, aboard, ground, and survivors across the dataset?
2. what is the Deadliest Location in terms of casualities?
3. What is the Country with the most crashes?
4. Which Aircraft has been involved the most with crashes?
5. Which Aircraft Manufacturer has the most crashes?
6. What is the trend in aircrashes over the years in terms of casialities?
7. What Month had the most crashes?
8. Which Airline Operator has the most number of crashes?

## Analysis Steps
To solve this research question, the following analysis steps were taken:
1.	Data Cleaning/ Transformation:
-	Retrieve the data set from online sourceâ€™s (Kaggle) and import into Anaconda
-	Fill/ remove records that are empty and remove duplicates  
-	Created a new column for total causality using the sum of the fatalities (air) and ground columns
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
-	Created charts to solve the research questions gotten
-	Filtered and sorted the pivot tables to fit my analysis
3.	Data Visualization
-	Used Python Visualisation library altair to create chart various types to visualize the charts to fit my analysis

## FINDINGS
1.	Geographic Trends:
-	In terms of deadliest location with the highest casualities New York  has the most.
-	The most affected Region with the most crashes is Russia.
2.	Aircraft & Operator Analysis
-	The operator with the most causalities and most crashes is Aeroflot
-	Aircraft manufactures Boeing have been involved the most in terms of crashes
3.	Time Seirs Trends:
-	The number of air crashes has reduced in the last four years over time due to improved safety measures

## CONCLUSION/ RECOMMENDATION
The air crash investigation analysis provides valuable insights into trends, factors contributing to aviation accidents. The study shows a decline in crash incidents, likely due to advancements in aviation technology and regulatory improvements. However, certain operators, aircraft manufacturers, and geographic regions exhibit higher crash frequencies, highlighting areas that may require further safety measures. Based off this some recommendations are provided below:
-	Operators should strengthen their safety measures most especially high-risk operators.
-	Aircraft manufacturer should improve aircraft maintenance and inspections for frequently involved aircraft models
-	Enhance safety awareness and training programs for pilots and airline staff.
- Research should be conducted on weather to know the time of the year safe for flight
